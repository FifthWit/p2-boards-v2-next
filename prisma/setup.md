# Prisma Stuff

Hello! if you want to get the DB up and running you need a MySQL db and I recommend you use the file [dump from the boards v1](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2Boards/blob/9290ef810af2b8b3fabc18a1cdfea2bdae668ea0/data/leaderboard.gz) when this site starts getting actually close to deployment I will make the docs good but rn im the only contributor(maybe because the docs idk) so the docs aren't going to get much attention

thanks for taking an interest in the project
